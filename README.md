# Tetris
Credit for the main design goes to RyiSnow as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1ktYfszqnM).

My additions to the game so far are:
- Implemented a "drop" function that will drop the tetromino into the lowest position it can go.
- Some minor refactoring for code clarity.
