Inspired by [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow). The game was re-architected to enhance modularity and testability by extracting distinct services, adding unit tests, enforcing encapsulation, and clearly separating state from behaviour. Additionally, new gameplay features were introduced, such as tetromino projection to preview landing spots, a hard drop function, a music mute toggle, and a counter that tracks the number of pieces that have been generated.
